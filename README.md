# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization

This repository contains my completed assignments for the "Applied Data Science with Python" specialization offered by the University of Michigan. The specialization consists of five courses that introduce learners to the field of data science using the Python programming language.

## Courses

1. **Introduction to Data Science in Python**
2. **Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python**
3. **Applied Machine Learning in Python**
4. **Applied Text Mining in Python**
5. **Applied Social Network Analysis in Python**

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into five folders, each corresponding to one of the specialization courses. Inside each course folder, you will find the relevant assignments.
